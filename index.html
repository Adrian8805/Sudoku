				<td>
				Client: Not Applicable<br>
				Dates of Meetings with the Client for developing this Plan: Not Applicable<br>
				Goal and Motivation:<br>
				The goal of sudoku solvers is to create an app that allows users to generate sudoku<br>
				puzzles at the press of a button. Not only will it generate puzzles but also give users an<br>
				option to solve the puzzle if they wish to see what the finished result will look like.<br>
				Current systems that implement a way to play sudoku suffer from limited variety,<br>
				abundant ads, and poor user interface. These issues cause frustration among potential<br>
				users and can deter them from using those versions of sudoku or make the users lose<br>
				interest in it.<br>
				Approach (key features of the system):<br>
				Generate puzzles<br>
				The user can create a new randomly generated board with a simple button click. This will<br>
				make sure you never play the same board with countless possible board generations.<br>
				Auto solver<br>
				While the user is solving the sudoku puzzle, they will have access to a button that will<br>
				instantly solve the puzzle for them. This auto solver will use a modern algorithm or<br>
				artificial intelligence techniques to solve the puzzle in a reasonably fast amount of time.<br>
				This auto solver will be useful to the user if they ever get stuck when trying to solve the<br>
				puzzle. We plan to expand upon this feature and add a “hint” button that can give the<br>
				user the correct number for a cell that the user is having difficulty filling in.<br>
				Having trouble finishing the puzzle? Or just curious to see what it would look like? You<br>
				will be able to have our application automatically complete any puzzle with a press of a<br>
				button. This process will fill in each spot in the puzzle with the correct number, showing<br>
				you how it would look when it's finished.<br>
				Various difficulties<br>
				Our application will be able to generate a random sudoku puzzle with exactly one<br>
				solution upon the user starting a new game. This puzzle will be a level of difficulty<br>
				depending on which difficulty setting the user picks. The difficulty of the puzzle will be<br>
				measured by how much information the puzzle gives to the user. The less information in<br>
				the puzzle, the harder the difficulty will be and vice versa. The amount of information can<br>
				be measured by how many cells are already filled in the puzzle.<br>
				The user can challenge themselves by asking the system to generate sudoku puzzles to<br>
				start with a different number of spaces already filled in. The user can increase or<br>
				decrease the number to match their preferences.<br>
				Gui Application<br>
				The User Interface Application will be the way the user can interact with the sudoku<br>
				puzzle. They will be able to launch the application and be greeted with a menu screen<br>
				where they can resume their last game or start a new game of sudoku with a variety of<br>
				difficulty settings for the user to choose from. They will then be launched into the game<br>
				itself and be able to interact with the empty cells in the sudoku puzzle to try and solve it.<br>
				During their gameplay, they will have access to a button that will instantly solve the<br>
				puzzle for the user if they get stuck and would like to see the solution.<br>
				The user can navigate easily through the application with simplistic approach<br>
				emphasizing easily understandable buttons that allow the user to go where they want<br>
				with minimal effort<br>
				Unique Solution<br>
				The user can be sure that when they start a puzzle it will be unique, ensuring that there<br>
				can be only one way the generated puzzle can be completed.<br>
				Novel Features/Functionalities:<br>
				Sudoku Solver/ Generator is not very novel, but we will make a novel GUI through<br>
				controls to easily navigate cells in the puzzle and a good looking, user friendly interface.<br>
				Algorithms and Tools:<br>
				PyQT for the GUI interface. Backtracking algorithms to solve puzzles.<br>
				Technical Challenges:<br>
				1. Before we can start our main task of creating an auto solver we have to create the base<br>
				game and GUI menu<br>
				2. When generating sudoku puzzles, it will be a challenge to make sure the puzzle has only
				one unique solution (Approximately 6.671×10
				21 unique Sudoku boards)
				3. We are not well versed in different Sudoku solving algorithms so testing and research<br>
				would need to be done to determine efficiency between different approaches<br>
				Milestone 1 (Sep 30) itemized tasks:<br>
				1. Research efficient solving strategies and unique game generation for Sudoku<br>
				2. Compare and select GUI libraries within python and collaboration tools for code and<br>
				work documents<br>
				3. Create Requirement Document<br>
				4. Create Design Document<br>
				5. Create Test Plan<br>
				Milestone 2 (Oct 28) itemized tasks:<br>
				1. Determine data structure to store Sudoku game board<br>
				2. Make GUI Interface with blank Sudoku game board that can be edited<br>
				3. Implement, test, and demo a base Sudoku game<br>
				Milestone 3 (Nov 25) itemized tasks:<br>
				1. Determine technique to test Sudoku board has one solution<br>
				2. Implement, test, and demo a Sudoku generator that generates games with a unique<br>
				solution<br>
				
				Approval from Faculty Advisor:<br>
				"I have discussed with the team and approve this project plan. I will evaluate the progress and<br>
				assign a grade for each of the three milestones."<br>
